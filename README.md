Afterglow is a lilypad client created to serve a better experience with QoL features and an improved survival experience, including many more extras.

# CONTRIBUTION GUIDE
Every file required to contribute to the project is found under the src folder, these are patch files you can use. Patch files contain every file modified.

# KNOWN PROBLEMS
- random crashing upon attempting to load a world via quickplay
- the cheat menu disabler doesnt actually work (weird problem with inputHandler)
- quickplay worlds dont save after closing (due to issues im having with getting them saved and allocated somewhere)
- upon exiting the world3 warning screen, the next button pressed no matter what will lead you back to the main menu instead of continuing as it should.

## THESE PROBLEMS SHOULD BE FIXED UPON THE NEXT RELEASE!
