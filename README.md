# CONTRIBUTION GUIDE
Every file required to contribute to the project is found under the src folder, there are patch files you can use. Patch files contain every file modified.
You can also see the files ive specifically created for the project because mojang are strict with their "no sharing source code" policy 

# KNOWN PROBLEMS
- random crashing upon attempting to load a world via quickplay (Issue with alpha)
- upon exiting the world3 warning screen, the next button pressed no matter what will lead you back to the main menu instead of continuing as it should.

## THESE PROBLEMS SHOULD BE FIXED UPON THE NEXT RELEASE!
